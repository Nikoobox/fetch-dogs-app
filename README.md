2. **Search for Dogs**: After logging in, users can search for available dogs with the following features:
   - Filter by breed, age, or zipcode.
   - Paginate results.
   - Sort results alphabetically by breed, with options for ascending or descending order, age or name.
   - View all fields of the Dog object.
   - Select favorite dogs from search results.
